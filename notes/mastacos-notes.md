I really like the idea of making a dashboard, but I don’t know if I have time for that within this semester. I don’t know how much I need to stick to the guided curriculum or how much I can go off and do my own thing. I want to make this a portfolio piece and make a brand design for this, but I don’t want to step on any toes since this is a class project.
