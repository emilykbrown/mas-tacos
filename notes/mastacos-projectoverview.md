My final deliverable will be an employee dashboard for Ma’s Tacos. It will include an RBAC system, an order processing system, a payroll system, an employee management system, and a vendor and inventory system. This is part of a bigger project I will build for a portfolio piece. I don’t know how much I will get done by the end of the semester so I am going to prioritize each category from most important to least important.

Prep tasks
Entity-relationship diagram (complete)
Logical and physical models
Data preparation
Menu planning
Datasets from Kagle
Fake data from Mockaroo, ChatGPT, and myself
Tech stack	
Frontend- Bootstrap, SCSS for simple styling
Backend- PHP
Database- MySQL
Stripe and PayPal APIs for payment
Storyboards and data flow- I plan on using Bootstrap and a simple UI to focus backend and database functionally. I want to quickly map out everything so I know what I’m working with and working towards.0

Stage I
RBAC system- make sure each employee has the appropriate permissions using the principle of least privilege.
Order Processing Systems- Track orders, table assignments, menu items, and order payments.
Employee management- Shift assignments, section assignments, management, timecards, schedules, and simple time tracking.

Stage II
Inventory and vendor management- Stock levels, restock alerts, and supplier management.
Simple payroll- basic salary and hourly wages, payroll processing, payslips, tips, and tax deduction

Stage III
Customer-side online ordering- Place ordes online and pay for orders using Stripe, PayPal, etc., schedule pick up times, order history, guest checkouts and user accounts, sales, promos, and giftcards
Anayltics dashboard- Sales analysis, payroll and shift analysis, inventory management trends, customer order trends

Stage IV
UX/UI- Brand identity, logo, colors, typography, responsive design



So, right now I'm working on the logical model which is a step away from creating the tables in SQL. I'm just wondering what order to do such as coding tables (I do have both MySQL database and PHPMyAdmin), setting up the frontend, working on the backend, a setting up RBAC, data collection (menu planning including), simple wireframes and workflow etc. What makes sense?
1️⃣ Logical Model → 2️⃣ Physical Model → 3️⃣ Backend (CRUD) → 4️⃣ RBAC → 5️⃣ Frontend → 6️⃣ Data Collection & Menu Planning → 7️⃣ Testing & Deployment

Is there a benefit of coding the tables before putting them into PHPMyAdmin?

What is the best order of building RBAC, creating users, and assigning roles?

What’s industry standard?

As project lead, I have taken this project off. Ma’s Taco was my idea due to my love of Mexican food and the name came from the phrase of mom’s and pop’s place. I decided to build an employee dashboard to apply the knowledge to a project I can use for my portfolio. Even though I’m doing my own thing, I want to still be team lead and help out when needed. I can also send some data whenever I get it. I know I am overlapping with some of my peers and will be happy to help wherever I can.
